<h1>javascript Fundamentals</h1>
<h2>Hello, world!</h2>
  <p>This is the first step in learning JavaScript. The script above shows a simple alert box with the message "Hello, world!"</p>

  <p>JavaScript is a versatile programming language that can be used for both client-side and server-side development.</p>

  <p>In this example, we are using an inline script to display a message when the page loads.</p>

  <h2>The ‚Äúscript‚Äù tag</h2>
  <p>
    JavaScript programs can be inserted almost anywhere into an HTML document using the script tag.
  The script tag contains JavaScript code which is automatically executed when the browser processes the tag.
  </p>
  <h2>Modern markup</h2>
  <p>
    The old HTML standard, HTML4, required a script to have a type. Usually it was type="text/javascript". 
    Its not required anymore. Also, the modern HTML standard totally changed the meaning of this attribute. Now, it can be used for JavaScript modules.
  </p>
  <h2>External scripts</h2>
  <p>
    If we have a lot of JavaScript code, we can put it into a separate file. Script files are attached to HTML with the src attribute:
  </p>
  <h4>here is script js file with src</h4>
  <script src="helloscript.js"></script>
  <p>script src="helloscript.js"script</p>
  <p>
    The browser loads the script from the specified URL and executes it. This is useful for keeping HTML files clean and separating concerns.
  </p>
  <p> We can give a full URL as well. and we can attach several scripts, use multiple tags </p>
  <h2>Please Note</h2>
  <p>
    a rule, only the simplest scripts are put into HTML. More complex ones reside in separate files.

The benefit of a separate file is that the browser will download it and store it in its cache.

Other pages that reference the same script will take it from the cache instead of downloading it, so the file is actually downloaded only once.

That reduces traffic and makes pages faster.

  <h1>Summary üìö</h1>
<ul>
  <li>We can use a script tag to add JavaScript code to a page.</li>
  <li>The type and language attributes are not required.</li>
  <li>A script in an external file can be inserted</li>
  <li>We can use the src attribute to specify the URL of an external script file.</li>
  <li>External scripts can be cached by the browser, improving performance.</li>
</ul>
  
  <h2> ‚úÖ Tasks </h2>
  <h3>show an alert</h3>
  <ul>
  <h2>-----Task 01-----</h2>
    <li>Create a page that shows a message ‚ÄúI am JavaScript!‚Äù</li>
    <li>Do it in a sandbox, or on your hard drive, doesn‚Äôt matter, just ensure that it works.</li>
  </ul>
  <script>
    alert('I am JavaScript!');
  </script>


      <h2>-----Task 02-----</h2>
  <h3>Show an alert with an external script</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Take the solution of the previous task Show an alert. Modify it by extracting the script content into an external file alert.js, residing in the same folder.</li>
    <li>Open the page, ensure that the alert works.</li>
  </ul>
  <script src="alert.js"></script>

<h2>Mini Q&A</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Do we need type="text/javascript" today? No.</li>
  <li>Can one script tag have both src and inline code? No; inline is ignored if src exists</li>
  <li>Why prefer external scripts? Caching + reuse across pages.</li>
  <li>When does an inline script execute? Exactly when the parser reaches it.</li>
  <li>Are language and HTML comment hacks inside script still needed? No; obsolete.</li>
</ol>
