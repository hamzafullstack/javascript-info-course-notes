#  Introduction to JavaScript

##  What is JavaScript?

- **Definition:** JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used to make web pages interactive and dynamic.  
- **Execution:** Scripts are executed as plain text within a web page's HTML, running automatically as the page loads.  
- **No Compilation Needed:** Unlike some languages, JavaScript doesn't require special preparation or compilation to run.  

##  Why is it called JavaScript?

- **Origin:** Initially named "LiveScript," the name was changed to "JavaScript" to capitalize on the popularity of Java at the time.  
- **Independence:** Despite the name, JavaScript is a fully independent language with its own specification called ECMAScript.  

##  Where Can JavaScript Run?

- **In the Browser:** Modern browsers have embedded JavaScript engines (e.g., V8 in Chrome, SpiderMonkey in Firefox) that execute scripts within the browser environment.  
- **On the Server:** With environments like Node.js, JavaScript can also run on the server, enabling full-stack development.  

##  How Does JavaScript Work?

1. **Parsing:** The JavaScript engine reads the script.  
2. **Compilation:** It converts the script into machine code.  
3. **Execution:** The machine code runs, with optimizations applied during execution for better performance.  

##  What Can JavaScript Do in the Browser?

- **DOM Manipulation:** Add, remove, or modify HTML elements and attributes.  
- **Event Handling:** Respond to user interactions like clicks, key presses, and mouse movements.  
- **AJAX Requests:** Communicate with servers asynchronously to fetch or send data without reloading the page.  
- **Local Storage:** Store data on the client side for persistent sessions.  

## What Can't JavaScript Do in the Browser?

- **Access Local Files:** JavaScript cannot read or write arbitrary files on the user's hard drive.  
- **Access System Resources:** It doesn't have access to system-level resources to ensure user security and privacy.
