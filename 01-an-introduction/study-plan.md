# Study Plan

## Goal
Study all the notes you’ve compiled so far:
- Introduction
- Manuals
- Code Editors
- DevTools

## Method
1. **Read each note actively**, not passively.  
2. **Explain it in your own words** after reading.  
3. **Mark any points that are unclear** for deeper focus later.
